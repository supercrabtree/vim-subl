INTRODUCTION                                    *subl*

Adds a simple command to open all your current vim buffers in sublime text and
attempts to find the project root and also open that.

COMMANDS                                        *subl-commands*

                                                *:Subl*
:Subl                   Opens your current buffer in sublime text, trying to
                        sensibly open your project as well. Looks to see if
                        the file is in a git repository and if it is loads
                        this as the project root. Otherwise it uses the files
                        parent directory as the project root.

                                                *:Subl!*

:Subl!                  Like |:Subl| except it runs on all of your currently
                        open buffers.
